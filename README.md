# What is SimpleSwade?
SimpleSwade is my solution to a problem I've had when preparing for TTRPG sessions where it takes too long creating character sheets just using a PDF editor. 
For other, more popular, TTRPGs like Dungeons and Dragons, there are already online tools for this problem, but none for SWADE.

My goal for this project is to create a streamlined web application that can be used to create, store, and edit player character sheets quickly and easily.

## Current Features
- Interactive example sheet with fillable areas and clickable buttons

## What's Next
- Saving sheets and storing them for later use/editing
- Main menu for navigating stored sheets and creating new ones
- Custom templates to further quicken the process
- Exporting to PDF
